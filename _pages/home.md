[금오공과대학교](https://www.kumoh.ac.kr) [토목공학과](https://civil.kumoh.ac.kr) 수문학연구실에서는 홍수, 가뭄 등 기후변화로 인해 인류에게 직접적인 영향을 미치는 물 문제에 대한 분석 방법 및 해결책에 대해 연구합니다.

We are a Hydrology and Water Resources Lab at Civil Engineering Department at [Kumoh National Institute of Technology](https://eng.kumoh.ac.kr). Our aim is to explore and characterize complexity and quantifying uncertainty in hydrology and water resources systems, with the goals of improving both our understanding of these systems and our ability to respond to water-related hazards under changing climate conditions.

주요 연구분야:
There are five main areas of research:

1. **도시 홍수 해석(Urban flood)**: Genomic analysis of DNA using high-throughput sequencing to identify genes associated with human disorders
2. **수문학적 자료 동화(Hydrologic data assimilation) **: Using whole-genome sequencing to identify the elements of the noncoding genome that contribute to ASD
3. **데이터기반 수문 해석(Data-driven hydrologic modeling)**: SCN2A mutations are one of the most common causes of ASD; we aim to understand how this risk is mediated with the view to developing therapeutics
4. **기후변화 적응 수자원 관리(Climate-adaptative water resource management)**: Leveraging functional genomic data to understand physiological brain development and the pathology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders
5. **멀티센서 수문 관측(Measuring hydrologic variables using multi-sensors)**: Identifying genes and gene networks that lead to the preponderance of males diagnosed with ASD

### 기술 및 방법론 Technologies and methods
The Sanders Lab is primarily a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, de novo mutation detection, RNA-Seq, and ChIP-Seq.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [State Lab](https://www.mstatelab.com/) and [Bender Lab](https://benderlab.ucsf.edu/lab-members) at UCSF, the [Devlin Lab](https://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/about-us/our-people/faculty/bernie-j-devlin-phd) at UPMC, the [Roeder Lab](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) at Carnegie Mellon, the [Sestan Lab](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/sestan/index.aspx), and the [Talkowski lab](http://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.
